The bundle size is significantly larger than recommended.
Consider reducing it with code splitting: https://goo.gl/9VhYWB
You can also analyze the project dependencies: https://goo.gl/LeUzfb

The project was built assuming it is hosted at auto.
You can control this with the homepage field in your package.json.

The build folder is ready to be deployed.
